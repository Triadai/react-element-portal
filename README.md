# React Element Portal

Render a React component inline, but target a DOM element (or elements) by id or selector.

## Why?

If you're making a shiny new React app where you use React everywhere, for every page, and for the entirety of every page, then you probably don't need this. But if you live in an imperfect world, where you have a server-generated header/footer or some static blog pages, or anything else not fully controlled by React, you can use an `ElementPortal` to control those things from inside a single root React element.

## Install

```bash
npm install react-element-portal --save
```

To get an ElementPortal bound to Redux Provider, you can use `react-redux-element-portal`.

```bash
npm install react-redux-element-portal --save
```

## Usage with vanilla React

Let's say we get this from the server:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <!-- Header generated by server -->
    <div id="header">
      <a href="/">Home</a>
      <h1>My Sorta Cool App</h1>
      <div id="user">Joe</div>
    </div>
    <!-- Container for React to do its thing -->
    <div id="app"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Even though we don't control the header, we can pretend like parts of it are owned by a single React root element.

```js
import ElementPortal from 'react-element-portal';

ReactDOM.render(
  // Just rendering a single React element.
  <div>
    {/* Use some React to spice up our header. */}
    <ElementPortal id="user">
      <div>
        <Menu>
          <Label>Joe</Label>
          <Items>
            <Item>Upgrade</Item>
            <Item>Settings</Item>
            <Item>Support</Item>
          </Items>
        </Menu>
      </div>
    </ElementPortal>
    {/* And render our main app as a sibling. */}
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <p>This is my main app and gets rendered to #app.</p>
    </div>
  </div>,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

You can also use a selector instead of an id.

```js
<ElementPortal selector=".header .user">
  <div>
    ...
  </div>
</ElementPortal>
```

## Passing context to your ElementPortal

When we render outside your main tree, context will be lost. For example, if you use with Redux, the `store` context gets lost, so `connect` won't work on children of your `ElementPortal`. You can use `createElementPortal` to create a custom ElementPortal that passes along context.

An example with Redux:

```js
import { createElementPortal } from 'redux-element-portal';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

// Bind an ElementPortal to a Provider component and pass 'store' context into that provider.
const ElementPortal = createElementPortal(Provider, ['store']);

const UserMenu = ({user}) => (
  <div>
    <Menu>
      <Label>{user.firstName}</Label>
      <Items>
        <Item>Upgrade</Item>
        <Item>Settings</Item>
        <Item>Support</Item>
      </Items>
    </Menu>
  </div>
);

const UserMenuContainer = connect(state => ({
  user: state.user
}))(UserMenu);

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <div>
      <ElementPortal id="user">
        <UserMenuContainer/>
      </ElementPortal>
    </div>
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

Redux is just an example here. You can pass along any context with your own custom component like `Provider`. Look at the [source for Provider](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/src/components/Provider.js) for reference. It's pretty simple. Just define some context that gets transferred from props to child context. Combine that with `createElementPortal` to customize your ElementPortal. If you want to use Redux _and_ some other custom context, just compose them together, creating your own Provider that internally also uses Redux's `Provider`.

## react-redux-element-portal

For Redux, you don't actually have to use `createElementPortal` at all, because there's already an npm package you can use that does it for you.

```js
import ElementPortal from 'react-redux-element-portal';

// ElementPortal is already bound to Provider.
```
